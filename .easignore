# EAS Update ignore file
# This overrides .gitignore for EAS builds and updates
# We need to include convex/_generated files even though they're in .gitignore

# Standard ignores
node_modules/
.expo/
.expo-shared/
*.log

# Keep convex/_generated files (don't ignore them like .gitignore does)
# This is critical for the app to work with Convex
